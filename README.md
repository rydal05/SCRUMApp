The general concept behind this app would be to have it work alongside some sort of MMORPG or online game experience wherein players would use their game accounts to suggest mechanics and features for the game explaining how it would benefit the game or how the mechanic would work for the game. Players are incentivized to use their primary accounts as rewards specific to that account would be granted upon introduction of said feature into the game. Inspiration for both the community and developers to interface with one another in a format such as this is taken from Team Fortress 2's in-game [reward system](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Finder%27s_Fee) for finding bugs and glitches and reporting them.
